#Pseudo Code practice 1
Initialize string userInput
prompt user to input
check if userInput consists of letters only
      if it doesnt then tell the user than they need to redo their input, then prompt them to input again
      else then program continues
check if userInput is already all caps
      if not then we will use .toUpper() to change the letters to their uppercase counterpart
      elsee then nothing happens
return userInput
-----------------------------------------------------------
#Pseudo Code Practice 2
init int number1
init int number2
init int result

try
prompt user to set number1 to an integer
catch if user does not input an integer then have them redo it

try
prompt user to set number2 to an integer
catch if user does not input an integer then have them redo it

set result equal to the sum of number1 and number2

return sum
-----------------------------------------------------------
#Pseudo Code Practice 3

init int userInput
init int sum = 0

while true
      try prompting user to set userInput to an integer
      catch if user does not input an integer and make them redo it
      add the value of userInput to sum
      ask user if they would like to add another numberr
              if yes then the loop begins again
              if not then break the loop

return sum
-----------------------------------------------------------
#Pseudo Code Practice 4

init int min = 0
init int max
init int output
init string input

while true
      try to prompt the user to set max to a valid integer
      catch if they do not input an integer and have them redo it

      set output to a random value using rand(0, 100)

      print output

      ask user if they would like to generate a new number
              if yes then the loop will start again
              else if no then break the loop
              else then the input is invalid and they will have to redo their input
-----------------------------------------------------------
#Pseudo Code Practice 5

init int randNum
init int leftCount
init int rightCount
init int total
while total > 11
    set randNum equal to a random number between 1 to 100 inclusively by using rand(1,100)
      if randNum when divided by 2 does not have any remainder, increase rightCount by 1
      else increase leftCount by 1
    increase total by 1

when loop ends print "Left : {leftCount}\tRight : {rightCount}"
